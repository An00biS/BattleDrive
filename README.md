BattleDrive is a simple and fast 2D combat game created using the
LÖVE (http://love2d.org/) framework.

About
-----

The title says it all; BD is a vehicle combat game where you drive with keys
and shoot with mouse. Fast to download, fast to load, fast to understand,
fast to play.

BD is designed with flexibility and easy extending in mind. In fact, it's
more of a game plattform than just a game. It's powered by many separate mods
and it easily accomodates new ones. The core of the program is a reusable
and well documented game creation framework, encouraging people to contribute.

Development status
------------------

The game is in alpha stage. In fact, it's not really a game yet, just
a technical demo.

Compatibility: LÖVE 0.7.1 or later
